    .notice 
        %p Every SwampCrash has questions.  Your goal is to guess the right answer.  Simple right?
        %p Well here's the catch.  You get points for each question you get right.
        %p You get a point based on how many other people also guessed your answer.
        %p If you are wrong, you get a penalty of 5 points MORE than the highest scoring correct answer
        %p The goal is to have the lowest score
        %p So you not only want to get the question right, but you want to guess the question that the LEAST number of people also guess.
